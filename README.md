# SCHOOL “THE BIOENGINEERING OF SPORT”
## HANDS-ON SESSIONS

Hands-on sessions are integral part of the school program and refer to the practical application of the theoretical contents presented during the school lectures. They will include data processing using different software enviroments and the interpretation of the obtained results.

Hands-on sessions will be done in groups and give the possibility to participate to the hands-on award.
Group creation will be done on the basis of the self-assessment survey that each participant should have filled by **September 9th, 2023**.

# Hands-on sessions
1)	Participation is mandatory.
   
1)	Composition of each team will be made available in this repository.
   
1)  Material for each hands-on session will be made available immediately before the specific session and will be stored in the specific folder of this repository.

# Hands-on Award
1) Participation is optional.
   
1) Each team should:
   
  - Fill-in a daily report (Google form) with the result(s) of each hands-on session. The link to the report will be provided during each hands-on session. The daily report will have to be sent before midnight of each hands-on session day.
    
  - Prepare a presentation following the 2023_GNB_School_Hands-on_template.pptx, available in this repository.
    
3) Five teams will be selected as finalists according to the daily report scores and will present their work on Thursday afternoon. The presentation of each team will be 6-minutes long.

# HARDWARE/SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
It is required to have a laptop in which all the following software enviroments/toolboxes/packages must be installed.
**IMPORTANT**: Download and installation should be done before starting the hands-on sessions.

- MATLAB: We suggest using the release 2023a. “Signal Processing Toolbox” and “Image Processing Toolbox” are required.

- R & RStudio: “https://github.com/irinagain/iglu” package is required.

- Web software: http://www.oxynet.net.

- PYTHON: “Statsbombpy” and “mplsoccer” libraries are required.

- Python: We suggest using a recent Python version, such as Python 3.x, as many libraries and notebooks are exclusively compatible with this version.

- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab: You will need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your computer. You can install it using pip (if you are using Python 3.x) with the following commands:
“pip install jupyterlab” or “pip install notebook”. Once installation is complete, you can launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab by executing the commands `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` from a terminal window. Libraries “mplsoccer” (https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and “pandas” (https://pandas.pydata.org/) are required.

- If you don't have an appropriate Python version on your machine or encounter any issues accessing or using the free Google Colab resource, you can access it at: https://colab.research.google.com/.
